# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation Hub. This collection of documents provides a comprehensive guide to how we run projects, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management methodology is built on principles of **customer-first thinking**, **iterative delivery**, **clear ownership**, **data-informed decisions**, and **psychological safety**. Our approach ensures that teams deliver high-quality products efficiently while maintaining transparency and fostering a culture of continuous learning.

### Key Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback and learning from mistakes

### Core Processes

Our project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible approach:

1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, align stakeholders, and define success criteria
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular cadence
4. **Release**: Deploy safely with proper verification and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Roles & Responsibilities

- **Project Managers**: Coordinate delivery, manage schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Managers**: Define outcomes, prioritize backlog, and measure success
- **Developers**: Implement features, write tests, and collaborate on design
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and business context

### Communication & Quality Assurance

- Weekly syncs between PM and Product Manager
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery teams
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Risk registers reviewed and updated weekly
- Automated testing, security scanning, and code review in CI/CD
- Regular demos and retrospectives to maintain alignment and learn
